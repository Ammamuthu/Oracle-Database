---------------------------
These commands manage Oracle Clusterware (CRS), the software that manages Oracle RAC clusters and other Oracle resources.


ps -ef | grep d.bin:
Finds and lists processes related to Oracle Clusterware (d.bin), helping you check if Oracle Clusterware daemons are running.

STATUS CHECKING 
----------------

crsctl check crs:
Checks the health of Oracle Clusterware services. It reports if CRS is running properly or facing issues.

crsctl status res -t:
Displays the status of all Oracle Clusterware resources (such as databases, listeners) in a table format.

crsctl status res -t -init:
Displays the status of all resources in the initialization state (after cluster startup).

crsctl check cluster -all:
Checks the status of Oracle Clusterware services across all nodes in the cluster.

START AND STOP CLUSTER IN SINGLE NODE
-------------------------------------

crsctl stop crs:
Stops all Oracle Clusterware services on the node, shutting down CRS.

crsctl stop crs -f:
Forces Oracle Clusterware services to stop, even if there are active processes or warnings.

crsctl start crs:
Starts Oracle Clusterware services on the node.

START AND STOP THE CLUSTER IN ALL NODE'S
----------------------------------------

crsctl stop cluster -all:
Stops Oracle Clusterware services across all nodes in the cluster.

crsctl start cluster -all:
Starts Oracle Clusterware services across all nodes in the cluster.

START AND STOP THE HIGN AVAILABILITY SERVICE:

srvctl stop database -d racdb:
Stops the specified Oracle RAC database (racdb), shutting down all its instances.

srvctl start database -d racdb:
Starts the specified Oracle RAC database (racdb), initializing its instances.

START AND STOP THE PARTICULAR INSTANCE:

srvctl stop instance -i racdb1 -d racdb:
Stops the specific instance (racdb1) of the racdb database.

srvctl stop instance -i racdb2 -d racdb:
Stops another instance (racdb2) of the racdb database.

srvctl start instance -i racdb1 -d racdb:
